# Machine Learning Project: Menstrual Cycle Prediction

Coursework for IKT @HTW-Berlin

## What is this project about?

In this project, I focused on using machine learning to predict the length of the menstrual cycle.
For this project I used this [data set about menstrual cycles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikitabisht/menstrual-cycle-data/data) found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
Detailed project documentation is available in German in the attached PDF `IKT-Projektdokumentation`.

## Project Notes

The respective project progress is recorded in the `project-notes` folder using jupyter-notebooks for the individual iterations.

## Run Streamlit App

To make the prediction accessible to users, Streamlit App was used to create a UI.

- use `streamlit run app.py` to run the app local

## Deployed Streamlit App

The project was successfully deployed via [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and can be accessed at the following URL:
